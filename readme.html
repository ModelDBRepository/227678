This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Knowlton CJ, Kutterer S, Roeper J, Canavier CC (2017)

Calcium dynamics control K-ATP channel mediated bursting in substantia
nigra dopamine neurons: a combined experimental and modeling study.
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00351.2017">J Neurophysiol :jn.00351.2017</a>

These model files were contributed by C Knowlton.

To build and run the model on a linux/unix platform type:

make
./fixed_finder > output.txt
./nmodel > output2.txt
After a short while an output file is generated which can be read into
your favorite graphing program. Matlab for example can produce the
following plot

load output2.txt;
a=output2;
z=4000; % look at the last couple of seconds of the run
figure
for b=2:9
subplot(2,4,b-1)
plot(a(end-z:end,1),a(end-z:end,b))
end

For the other output.txt file column 3 (x) and 1 (y) are used in
figures 6 7 and 8 for the V vs ADP phase plots.
